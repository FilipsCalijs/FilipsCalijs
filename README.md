Hello everyone, I'm a junior developer.<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30px">My journey in IT began in 2020, then I began to study the Python programming language, during that time I learned a lot (how git/github works, the basics of Django, Flask and much more), I also became acquainted with the basics and principles Go language. And recently, I began to delve deeper into Frontend: I began to study JS, TS, the basics of REACT, and also practiced my knowledge on different platforms, such as Chekio and LeetCode. I also started making my own websites on platforms such as Shopify and Wordpress.
